# Density-Matrix-Renormalization
This is a project I did during my first semester where I learned objective programming and used it to write a DMRG code. Main is "DMRG clean" and the rest are just me experimenting different things.

In "DMRG clean", I define a matrix product state (MPS) class and a matrix product operator (MPO) class. I use these to solve for the ground state of a 1d transverse ising model. To check my results, I calculate the local entropy and compare to a known theoretical result.
